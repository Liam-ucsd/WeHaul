# WeHaul
COGS 120 Winter 2017
##Source Control Protocol
Make a new branch titled dev-"name" using your name. Do your tasks on your branch only.

Merge your changes into Master only when you are sure that it works as intended.

Master should be our "demo" branch: if we need to show off a working version of the app, it will be through Master.

Make sure your commit messages are informative! They do not need to list every change involved in a given push, but make sure that they list major changes.

After a push has resolved an item on the dev plan, please update the status of the task accordingly.

##Tech info
The app will be running through Node and can be run locally by entering

`node app.js`

into your command line.

We will be using Angular.js for our interactivity portions and Bootstrap for the styling and layout.
